# Serverless_Sending_Application

This project is all about sending email and sms from a website using serveless services on aws. I started with creating a simple html form that can be used to input the email address and message. After that, I created an AWS Lambda function that can be used to send the email and sms. Finally, I deployed the Lambda function on AWS and tested it out. Overall, this was a fun project that taught me how to use serveless services on AWS.
