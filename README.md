# Serverless_Sending_Application

This project is all about sending emails and SMS from a website using serverless services on AWS. I started with creating a simple HTML form that can be used to input the email address and message. After that, I created an AWS Lambda function that can be used to send email and SMS. Finally, I deployed the Lambda function on AWS and tested it out. Overall, this was a fun project that taught me how to use serverless services on AWS.
